    <h2><p>Spaghetti al Limone: a beautiful, refreshing recipe for (not only) the summertime!</p></h2>
    <h3><p>Ingredients</p></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g spghaetti or more, depending on appetite</li>
        <li>5 slices of preserved lemon or zest of 1 organic lemon</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>80g Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2tbsp crème fraîche</li>
        <li>1 handful of finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li>Freshly grounded white pepper (whole)</li>
        <li>1 handful of arugula leaves</li>
        <li>2tbsp extra fine olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>   
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>As always, the sauce should wait for the pasta. However, since the sauce is so quick to make, we'll start with the pasta. So: bring a large pot of water (at least 4 liters) to a boil.</li>
        <li>Then, add a handful of salt. The water should be as salty as the sea in summer.</li>
        <li>Add the spaghetti and stir well after a minute to prevent them from sticking together. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions—or for as long as you like them.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the preserved lemon slices. Or, if using an organic lemon, wash it thoroughly with hot water and zest the peel.</li>
        <li>Place all ingredients except for the parsley, arugula, and olive oil into a food processor (). Alternatively, use an immersion blender (). Blend everything for 2-3 minutes until the sauce is smooth and free of large chunks.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><h4>Lemon Sauce Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Season with salt and white pepper. Black pepper works too, but it will leave dark specks in the light sauce.</li>   
    </ol>
    <p><h4>Blending the Lemon Sauce</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Just before the pasta is done, set aside about 200 ml of the cooking water.
            Drain the pasta in a colander (*), letting it drip briefly. Then return the pasta to the warm pot or transfer it to a pre-warmed bowl.</li>
        <li>Quickly mix in the sauce. Then fold in the chopped parsley and arugula leaves. If the pasta absorbs too much liquid, add a bit of the reserved cooking water.</li>
        <li>Finally, drizzle some good olive oil over the top in a fine stream. Serve immediately.</li>
